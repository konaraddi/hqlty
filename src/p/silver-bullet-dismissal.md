Responding to a nuanced concern with a one-line fix, as if the problem just needs the right tool.

"AGENTS.md is for that."

"Just use Kubernetes."

"Have you tried the latest version?"

"That's what tests are for."

### Why It's Unproductive

Sounds helpful but treats a complex problem as if the person just hasn't found the right button to press. When someone articulates a nuanced concern, a one-liner doesn't address it. It signals "this isn't actually hard" without doing any of the work to show why. The person raising the issue often already knows about the tool being suggested and has reasons it doesn't solve the deeper problem.

## The Better Move

"X helps with part of that, but I agree it doesn't fully solve the deeper issue."

"I've had some luck with X for this. What specifically has been tripping you up?"

"That's a real limitation. X mitigates it somewhat, but there's no clean fix yet."

"Good point. I think the tooling is getting closer but isn't there yet."

### Why It's Better

Acknowledges the complexity of the concern while still sharing useful information. Treats the other person as someone who's thought about this, not someone who missed an obvious solution.

## Example

**OP**: "AI coding tools still struggle with large codebases. They lose track of architecture and slowly degrade structure without human oversight."

**Antipattern reply**: "That's what AGENTS.md is for."

**Better**: "Context files help, but yeah, maintaining coherent architecture across a large codebase is still where human judgment matters most."
