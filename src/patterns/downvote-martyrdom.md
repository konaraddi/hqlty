## The Pattern

Editing comments to complain about downvotes or claim they prove correctness.

"EDIT: Downvotes prove I'm right."

"EDIT: Keep downvoting, doesn't make me wrong."

"EDIT: Wow, downvoted for telling the truth."

"EDIT: The downvotes just show people can't handle facts."

### Why It's Unproductive

Sounds like standing firm under pressure but reframes disagreement as persecution. It's tempting because downvotes feel like unfair silencing, but complaining about them turns the discussion into meta-commentary about votes rather than substance. Treats vote counts as validation rather than considering whether the argument itself needs adjustment.

## The Better Move

If downvoted, consider whether the point could be clearer or better supported.

Edit to add sources or clarify, not to complain: "EDIT: Adding source for this claim: [link]"

Respond to specific criticisms in replies instead of making it about votes.

Or simply leave it. Not every comment needs defending.

### Why It's Better

Focuses on improving the argument rather than prosecuting the audience. Treats downvotes as feedback about communication or evidence, not as proof of correctness through opposition.

## Example

**Original comment**: "This policy will backfire because [argument]." [Gets downvoted]

**Antipattern**: "EDIT: Getting downvoted for stating facts. Stay mad, Reddit."

**Better**: "EDIT: For those asking for evidence, here's the analysis I'm basing this on: [link]. Happy to discuss specific concerns."
