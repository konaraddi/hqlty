## The Pattern

Framing questions as "Why did you..." instead of exploring motivation or reasoning.

"Why did you choose that approach?"

"Why did you think that was a good idea?"

"Why did you do it that way?"

"Why did you even bother with this?"

### Why It's Unproductive

Puts people on the defensive before a conversation can start. It's easy to fall into because asking "why" feels neutral, but phrasing it as "why did you" frames the action as something requiring justification rather than explanation. Signals suspicion or disapproval, making the other person protect their choice instead of discussing it openly.

## The Better Move

"What's the motivation for taking this approach?"

"I'm curious about the reasoning here. What led to this decision?"

"Can you walk me through the thinking on this?"

"What problem is this solving?"

### Why It's Better

Invites explanation without implying judgment. Keeps the conversation exploratory rather than defensive, making it easier to discuss tradeoffs or alternative approaches.

## Example

**Original**: "I decided to refactor the authentication module before adding the new features."

**Antipattern**: "Why did you do that? We needed those features shipped yesterday."

**Better**: "What's the motivation for doing the refactor first? I'm trying to understand the tradeoffs with the feature timeline."
