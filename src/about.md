This is a collection of common patterns that happen in online conversations on platforms like Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter, and other internet forums. These aren't insults or trolling. They're moves that feel natural in the moment but tend to make discussions less productive and focused.

Each pattern includes:
- Examples of what it looks like
- Why it tends to backfire
- Better alternatives that keep conversations on track

The goal isn't to win arguments or prove anyone wrong. It's to help make online spaces a bit more pleasant, productive, and focused for everyone. We recognize this isn't an objective in all online spaces (though we hope it'd be the case more often).

## How to Use These

If you see one of these patterns in an online discussion (including your own comments), these pages can help redirect things constructively.

**When linking to a pattern:**
- Stay respectful and assume good intent
- Focus on the conversation pattern, not the person
- Pair it with engagement on the actual topic
- Remember that you're trying to improve the discussion, not score points

**Example:** Instead of just dropping a link, you might say: "I think we might be talking past each other here. [This pattern](link) describes what I'm seeing. On the actual question about X, I think..."

The point is to get conversations back on track, not to lecture people about how they communicate.

## Who This Is For

### Self-improvement
Reading patterns to recognize and improve your own discourse habits in online discussions.

### Constructive response
Politely linking to patterns when you see antipatterns in Reddit threads, HN comment sections, Twitter debates, and other online forums.

### Observer learning
Understanding what makes online conversations go sideways, whether on social media or discussion boards.

### What Success Looks Like

When someone gets linked to a pattern in an online discussion, ideally:
- They understand the issue without feeling attacked
- The conversation gets back on track
- Other participants learn from the example
