This is an open project. If you've spotted a common antipattern that isn't covered, or think an existing pattern could be improved, contributions are welcome.

## What Makes a Good Antipattern

Not every bad conversational habit qualifies. A pattern belongs here if it:

- **Sounds reasonable** on the surface but derails productive discussion
- **Happens frequently** in online discourse (Reddit, HN, Twitter, forums)
- **Has clear alternatives** that keep conversations constructive
- **Isn't just rude** -- it's a subtle, widespread habit people often don't realize they're doing

If someone would immediately recognize the behavior as hostile, it probably doesn't need a page here. The interesting patterns are the ones that feel normal until you look closer.

## How to Contribute

Head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/konaraddi/odap) to open issues or submit pull requests.

**To propose a new pattern:** Open an issue describing the pattern, a couple of examples, and why it damages conversation. If it fits, you or someone else can write it up as a full page.

**To improve an existing pattern:** If an example feels off, the tone is wrong, or a better alternative exists, open a PR with the change.

## Pattern Structure

Every pattern page follows this format:

### 1. Frontmatter
```yaml
---
slug: pattern-name
title: Pattern Name
---
```

### 2. The Pattern
A brief description of the antipattern, followed by 3-4 short example quotes showing how it shows up in conversation. Focus on the structure, not specific topics. Show variety in how the pattern appears.

### 3. Why It's Unproductive
2-3 sentences explaining what this pattern does to the conversation and why people fall into it. Assume good intent. Acknowledge the human element (ego, defensiveness, social positioning) without getting into pop psychology. Avoid using "you" -- use "it signals" or "this communicates" instead.

### 4. The Better Move
3-4 concrete alternative phrasings that accomplish the same goal constructively. These should sound natural, not preachy.

### 5. Why It's Better
1-2 sentences on why the alternatives work better. Focus on practical benefits.

### 6. Real Example
A realistic scenario showing the original comment, the antipattern reply, and a better alternative. Keep it brief and use a neutral topic.

```markdown

## Example

**OP**: "New study shows that regular exercise improves mood."

**Antipattern reply**: "Well duh, anyone could have told you that."

**Better**: "Makes sense. Have there been any surprising findings
about which types of exercise work best?"
```

## Tone Guidelines

The person reading a pattern page may have just been linked there for doing the thing described. Keep that in mind.

**Do:**
- Assume good intent
- Stay respectful and empathetic
- Be direct and concise
- Sound like a thoughtful friend, not a lecturer
- Keep it readable in under 60 seconds

**Don't:**
- Be preachy or condescending
- Use academic jargon
- Make people feel stupid
- Overexplain the psychology
- Use em dashes in prose

## Naming Patterns

Use descriptive, neutral names. The name should identify the behavior without passing judgment.

- Good: `hindsight-dismissal`, `pedantic-deflection`
- Bad: `being-a-know-it-all`, `annoying-nitpicking`

## Quick Checklist

Before submitting a new pattern, check that:

- [ ] The pattern is common and recognizable in online discussions
- [ ] Examples are short, generic, and show variety
- [ ] The tone passes the "would I feel okay being linked here?" test
- [ ] Alternatives are genuinely useful and natural-sounding
- [ ] The real example uses a neutral topic
- [ ] The whole page reads in under 60 seconds
