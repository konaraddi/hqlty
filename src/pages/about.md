The internet could be a better place for discourse. This is a reference guide on antipatterns in replies — unproductive expressions that aren't conducive to pleasant, productive, and focused discussion. Not logical fallacies, just things people say without realizing they're shutting the conversation down.

Each pattern includes:
- Examples of what it looks like
- Why it tends to backfire
- Better alternatives that keep conversations on track

The goal isn't to win arguments or prove anyone wrong. It's to make online conversations a little more productive, one reply at a time.

## How to Use These

If you see one of these patterns in an online discussion (including your own comments), these pages can help redirect things constructively.

**When linking to a pattern:**
- Stay respectful and assume good intent
- Focus on the conversation pattern, not the person
- Pair it with engagement on the actual topic
- Remember that you're trying to improve the discussion, not score points

**Example:** Instead of just dropping a link, you might say: "I think we might be talking past each other here. [This pattern](https://example.com) describes what I'm seeing. On the actual question about X, I think..."

The point is to get conversations back on track, not to lecture people about how they communicate.

## Who This Is For

### Self-improvement
Reading patterns to recognize and improve your own discourse habits in online discussions.

### Constructive response
Politely linking to patterns when you see antipatterns in Reddit threads, HN comment sections, Twitter debates, and other online forums.

### Observer learning
Understanding what makes online conversations go sideways, whether on social media or discussion boards.

### What Success Looks Like

When someone gets linked to a pattern in an online discussion, ideally:
- They understand the issue without feeling attacked
- The conversation gets back on track
- Other participants learn from the example
