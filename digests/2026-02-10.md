**Parent comment**:
> Ethics are all well and good but I would prefer to have quantified limits for water quality with strict enforcement and heavy penalties for violations.

**This comment**:
> Of course. But while the lawmakers hash out the details it's good to have companies that err on the safe side rather than the "get rich quick" side.
> 
> Formal restrains and regulations are obviously the correct mechanism, but no world is perfect, so whether we like it or not ourselves and the companies we work for are ultimately responsible for the decisions we make and the harms we cause.
> 
> De-emphasizing ethics does little more than give large companies cover to do bad things (often with already great impunity and power) while the law struggles to catch up. I honestly don't see the point in suggesting ethics is somehow not important. It doesn't make any sense to me (more directed at gp than parent here)

**This comment**:
> Handy is awesome! and easy to fork. I highly recommend building it from source and submitting PRs if there are any features you want. The author is highly responsive and open to vibe-coded PRs as long as you do a good job. (Obviously you should read the code and stand by it before you submit a PR, but I just mean he doesn't flatly reject all AI code like some other projects do.) I submitted a PR recently to add an onboarding flow to Macs that just got merged, so now I'm hooked

**This comment**:
> I've had mixed luck.
> 
> My current house, with low-E windows, aluminum siding, and a metal roof?  It passionately hates everything about GPS.
> 
> But in more-typical (stick-framed, asphalt shingled, vinyl-sided, US-ish) houses?  I haven't had any trouble with my very inexpensive u-blox (or perhaps clone) GPS board, a presumed-decent GPS antenna that we were throwing away at work, and dainty little [IIRC] u.FL to SMA adapter to connect the antenna with.  (I put this all together just to play with making a GPS-backed, low-stratum NTP server -- which was a much more-rewarding process than it had any right to be.)
> 
> It was bizarrely good, in fact:  While it certainly saw more birds and presumably had better accuracy when sitting in a window, I had real trouble getting it to cease to operate.  It seemed to lock on well-enough to provide time and PPS until I put the antenna into a windowless closet.
> 
> That said:  The antenna that came with this cheap receiver was trash -- at best, 1/10.  It was hard to make it work even outdoors on a clear day.  I eventually got sick of looking at that part and binned it.

**Parent comment**:
> That's cool - I'd imagine 'invested in a mining concern' is rare on the spectrum of HNers' resumes. May I ask how did you come to be confident enough to risk capital on something that's not typically within the average tech person's familiarity space?  Asking b/c I would like to be able to develop such confidence if I could credibly (even just to myself) do so.

**This comment**:
> My foray into rare earths, critical minerals and some defense stocks was initially as a hedge against Trump starting a trade war with China, the increasing risk of military confrontation and the rearming of Europe. All three concerns have occurred to some degree, but it's a long game and actually took a lot longer to play out than I had expected in some cases.
> 
> And I get your lack of confidence, I did miss some quick opportunities that I felt were there but I wasn't confident at the time.
> 
> The only way to really gain confidence is do your research; read the presentations of each company, particularly their JORC-compliant estimates, time frames to production, how far along the funding path they are, etc.
> 
> Use your preferred LLM for deep dives. Whatever you're question, just ask and you'll be surprised at what you learn. For example asking for a cost/effort comparison of the metallurgic processes required for each type of rare earth host material really helped me understand what they were doing, and how each company differed in their approach.

> If you like learning random things on Hacker News, deep diving into any technology or industry will not be an issue.

> The negative impacts of generative AI are most sharply being felt by "creatives" (artists, writers, musicians, etc), and the consumers in those markets. If the OP here is 1. a programmer 2. who works solely with other programmers and 3. who is "on the grind", mostly just consuming non-fiction blog-post content related to software development these days, rather than paying much attention to what's currently happening to the world of movies/music/literature/etc... then it'd be pretty easy for t...

**This comment**:
> >"Anti-LLM sentiment" within software development is nearly non-existent
> 
> This is certainly untrue. I want to say "obviously", which means that maybe I am misunderstanding you. Below are some examples of negative sentiments programmers have - can you explain why you are not counting these?
> 
> NOTE: I am not presenting these as an "LLMs are bad" argument. My own feelings go both ways. There is a lot that's great about LLMs, and I don't necessarily agree with every word I've written below - some of it is just my paraphrasing of what other people say. I'm only listing examples of what drives existing anti-LLM sentiment in programmers.
> 
> 1. Job loss, loss of income, or threat thereof
> 
> These two are exacerbated by the pace of change, since so many people already spent their lives and money establishing themselves in the career and can't realistically pivot without becoming miserable - this is the same story for every large, fast change - though arguably this one is very large and very fast even by those standards. Lots of tech leadership is focusing even more than they already were on cheap contractors, and/or pushing employees for unrealistic productivity increases. I.e. it's exacerbating the "fast > good" problem, and a lot of leadership is also overestimating how far it reduces the barrier to creating things, as opposed to mostly just speeding up a person's existing capabilities. Some leadership is also using the apparent loss of job security as leverage beyond salary suppression (even less proportion of remote work allowed, more surveillance, worse office conditions, etc).
> 
> 2. Happiness loss (in regards to the job itself, not all the other stuff in this list)
> 
> This is regarding people who enjoy writing/designing programs but don't enjoy directing LLMs; or who don't enjoy debugging the types of mistakes LLMs tend to make, as opposed to the types of mistakes that human devs tend to make. For these people, it's like their job was forcibly changed to a different, almost unrelated job, which can be miserable depending on why you were good at - or why you enjoyed - the old job.
> 
> 3. Uncertainty/skepticism
> 
> I'm pushing back on your dismissal of this one as "not anti-LLM sentiment" - the comparison doesn't make sense. If I was forced to only review junior dev code instead of ever writing my own code or reviewing experienced dev code, I would be unhappy. And I love teaching juniors! And even if we ignore the subset of cases where it doesn't do a good job or assume it will soon be senior-level for every use case, this still overlaps with the above problem: The mistakes it makes are not like the mistakes a human makes. For some people, it's more unnatural/stressful to keep your eyes peeled for the kinds of mistakes it makes. For these people, it's a shift away from objective, detail-oriented, controlled, concrete thinking; away from the feeling of making something with your hands; and toward a more wishy-washy creation experience that can create a feeling of lack of control.
> 
> 4. Expertise loss
> 
> A lot of positive outcomes with LLMs come from being already experienced. Some argue this will be eroded - both for new devs and existing experienced devs.
> 
> 5. The training data ownership/morality angle

You can't do much with the architecture in Javascript though, because it doesn't allow you to map memory directly to your types (unless there's some ungodly nonesense I'm not aware of) so you'll have to drop into C/asm to e.g. interact with the ports/registers/tables to set up userspace.
