> Ok, obviously unethical to do it, but this sounds like you've got the power to create some sci-fi shared dreaming device, where you can read people's brainwaves and send signals to other people's masks based on those signals. Or send signals to everyone at the same time and suddenly people all across the world experience some change in their dream simultaneously.

> I learned linux by using Arch back in the days when pacman -Syu was almost certain to break something and there was a good chance it would break something unique to your install. This was also back in the days when most were not connected to the internet 24/7 and many did not have internet, I updated when I went to the library which was generally a weekly thing but sometimes it be a month or two and the system breakage that resulted was rococo. Something was lost by Arch becoming stable and not breaking regularly, it was what drove the wiki and fixing all the things that pacman broke taught you a great deal and taught you quickly. Stability is not all that it is cracked up to be, has its uses but is not the solution to everything.

**This comment**:
> I didn't really get into custom kernels until I started using Crux. A few years after I started using Arch I got sick of the rolling release and Arch's constant breakages, so I started looking into the alternatives, that brought me to Crux (which Arch was based off of) and Slackware (which was philosophically the opposite of Arch without sacrificing the base understanding of the OS). Crux would have probably won out over Slackware if it were not for the switch to 64bit, when confronted with having to recompile everything, I went with the path of least resistance. Crux is what taught me to compile a kernel, in my Arch days I was lucky when it came to hardware and only had to change a few things in the config which the Arch wiki guided me through.
> 
> Crux is a great distro for anyone ok with a source distro and I think it might be the best source distro, unlike the more common source distros, it does not do most of the work for you. Also love its influence from BSD, which came in very handy when I started to explore the BSDs and FreeBSD which is my fallback for when Patrick dies or steps back, Crux deserves more attention.

Is there not enough evidence posted almost daily on HN that tech companies are constantly spying on their users through computers, Internet-of-Shit devices, phones, cars and even washing machines? You might not care about the brainwave data specifically, but there is bound to be information on your devices that you expect remains private.

> I have a hard time getting them to write small and flexible functions. Even with explicit instructions about how a specific routine should be done. (Really easy to produce in bash scripts as they seem to avoid using functions, but so do people, but most people suck at bash) IME they're fixated on the end goal and do not grasp the larger context (which is often implicit though I still find difficulty when I'm highly explicit. Which at that point it's usually faster to write myself)
> 
> It also makes me question context. Are humans not doing this because they don't think about it or because we've been training people to ignore things? How often do we hear "I just care that it works?" I've only heard that phrase from those that also love to talk about minimum viable products because... frankly, who is not concerned if it works? That's always been a disagreement about what is sufficient. Only very junior people believe in perfection. It's why we have sayings like "there's no solution more permanent than a temporary fix that works". It's the same people who believe tests are proof of correctness rather than a bound on correctness. The same people who read that last sentence and think I'm suggesting to not write tests or believe tests are useless.

**This comment**:
> What? Yes they do take shortcuts and hacks. They change the tests case to make it pass. As the context gets longer it is less reliable at following earlier instructions. I literally had Claude hallucinate nonexistent APIs and then admitted “You caught me! I didn’t actually know, let me do a web search” and then after the web search it still mixes deprecated patterns and APIs against instructions.

**This comment**:
> I maintain a fork of sqlite-vec (because there hasn't been activity on the main repo for more than a year): sqlite-vec is great for smaller dimensionality or smaller cardinality datasets, but know that it's brute-force, and query latency scales exactly linearly. You only avoid full table scans if you add filterable columns to your vec0 table and include them in your WHERE clause. There's no probabilistic lookup algorithm in sqlite-vec.

While some of the excesses of the past were clearly excessive, drilled holes should have been sufficient evidence of drills, people living on islands should be sufficient evidence of boats, rope-worn bones should be considered evidence of rope and so forth.

**This comment**:
> It's possible to put holes through things without a drill.  People can get onto islands without boats.  How do you define rope, and what else might cause similar wear?  Are you certain you can distinguish them?
> 
> Archaeology has come a long way over the last couple of centuries.  It used to be little better than grave robbing and crackpot (often racist) theories.  Archaeologists made all sorts of assumptions that turned out to be ridiculously (and sometimes tragically) wrong.  Excavations once involved dynamite and bulldozers.  Things have changed.  Techniques for re-analyzing and extracting new information from old finds are allowing archaeologists to make discoveries without digging at all.  Even a careful, modern dig is a destructive act that can only be conducted once.
