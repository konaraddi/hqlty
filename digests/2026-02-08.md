> I'm not sure I will ever understand the presentation of "inevitable === un-criticizable" as some kind of patent truth. It's so obviously fallacious that I'm not sure what could even drive a human to write it, and yet there it is, over and over and over.
> 
> Lots of horrifying things are inevitable because they represent "progress" (where "progress" means "good for the market", even if it's bad for the idea of civilization), and we, as a society, come to adapt to them, not because they are good, but because they are.

> For chronic diseases that tend to be caused by obesity, the expensive bits tend to be towards retirement aged people - or are so disabling that people drop out of the workforce early.
> 
> In either case the vast majority of those costs will be incurred by either Medicare or Medicaid. Or at least the next insurer in line as the typical worker doesn’t spend an entire career at the same firm with the same insurance provider.
> 
> By the time any cost savings benefits have been realized (call it a decade later), chances are that insured patient is long gone and all they were was an additional expense.
> 
> By the time government gets involved you have someone who has been obese all their life and the damage is largely already done. Even if you paid for the meds now, the savings are limited.
> 
> Given the market already though - these drugs will be affordable to the average working person within a few years

> The popularity of a genre is deeply tied to the historical context of what's going on in the real world. In the 1950s and 1960s you obviously had the Space Race, which itself was a product of the Cold War. Some commments view this as optimism. I disagree. I view it as an expression of patriotism.
> 
> I view this patriotism as a crutch in uncertain times. Another example of this is the rise of the superhero genre in the 21st century. Marven was skirting with bankruptcy in the 1990s. A perpetual Spiderman license was sold for a fraction of what it would today. And I think it's no coincidence that the superhero genre ascended post-9/11.
> 
> I used to read a lot of fantasy but many years ago I pretty much switched almost entirely to sci-fi. For me the reason was because sci-fi asked questions. I mean  there's also space opera and it scratches the same itch as fantasy (IMNHO) but my personal interest in sci-fi is more in the "what if" category.
> 
> That's a very broad category that goes all the way from, say, the Iain M. Banks Culture series, which really poses the question of what an ultra-high tech post-scarcity civilization looks like to something like The Handmaid's Tale (yes, that's sci-fi). We've also had some superb sci-fi on the screen in recent years like Severance, Silo and The Expanse.
> 
> For me, fantasy is a far more limited genre. Like I'm trying to read Brandon Sanderson recently and while he's a good writer, it's just not hooking me yet in the same way that, say, Revelation Space did. I think the last fantasy series to really hook me was A Song of Ice and Fire. The first three books are some of the finest books ever written.
> 
> But as for the decline of starships, I think that the readership has evolved too. More vintage sci-fi simply projected the era of exploration and colonization onto space and it's become pretty clear how unrealistic that is because of the vast distances involved. You have to remember that popular media in the 1960s expected Moon bases and such in the not-too-distant future. Star Trek was really the last gasp of this and, interestingly, Star Trek is fundamentally socialist, which is noteworthy given that it originated in the Cold War.
> 
> Star Wars on the other hand was a tale of the resistance to imperialism. George Lucas has said he modeled the resistance on the North Vietnamese. Cyberpunk came about in the 1980s (eg Neuromancer, Blade Runner) that had nothing to do with starships but they really reflected a societal pessimism. Cyberpunk is inherently xenophobic (ie because of fears of the Japanese).
> 
> I wonder if the popularity of fantasy is fundamentally escapist and an expression of helplessness. Think about it: fantasy usually revolves around the outsized impact of individual actions, of a hero or heroine.

> Linux is the objectively best choice for a significant number of use-cases at the moment (not all of them). Using Linux and communicating that doesn't necessarily make you a "Linux guy."
> 
> Obviously, using Linux when a better solution exists for whatever you're trying to solve equally applies. While it may not be unhealthy, it certainly isn't a good idea.

> With Claude code I live in plan mode, and ask it to hand me the implementation plan at the low level, with alternatives. It's rare for it to not give me good ones: Better than the junior dev. Then the plan it has is already limited enough that, along with its ability to maintain code style, I will see code very similar to what I would have done. There are a couple of things in the .md file to try to make it take a step or two like the ones I would on naming, shrinking the diff, and refactoring for deduplication. It's not going to go quite as fast as trusting it all to work at a large scale, but it sure looks like my code in the end.

> It only does if & while, not for. A goto in a single-pass thing would need separate handling for forwards vs backwards jumps, which involves keeping track of data per name (in a form where you can tell when it's not yet set; whereas if/while data is freely held in recursion stack). And you'd still need to handle at least `if ( expr ) goto foo;` to do any conditionals at all.
