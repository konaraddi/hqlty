**Parent comment**:

**This comment**:
> "They're moving the goalposts" is increasingly the autistic shrieking of someone with no serious argument or connection to reality whatsoever.
> 
> No one cares about how "AGI" or whatever the fuck term or internet-argument goalpost you cared about X months ago was. Everyone cares about what current tech can do NOW, and under what conditions, and when it fails catastrophically. That is all that matters.
> 
> So, delineating conditions of an LLM win (or loss) is all that matters. Complaining that some people see some recent result as a loss (or win) is just completely missing the game.

> It's important to note they aren't creating laws against infinite scrolling, but are ruling against addictive design and pointing to infinite scrolling as an example of it. The wording here is fascinating, mainly because they're effectively acting as arbiters of "vibes". They point to certain features they'd like them to change, but there is no specific ruling around what ...

**This comment**:
> "what specific laws ...?"
> 
> If a company chooses a design and it can be proved through a subpoena of their communications that the design was intended and chosen for its addictive traits, even if there has been no evidence collected for the addictiveness, then the company (or person) can be deemed to have created a design in bad faith to society and penalized for it.

**Story**: Faster Than Dijkstra?

**Parent comment**:
> In the most extreme case of this, you can use Counting Sort. Tangential to this, Spaghetti Sort makes me wonder about which parts of CS (especially the data structures, like arrays) are objective or just accidental.
> 
> The transdichotomous model looks interesting.

**This comment**:
> If we're taking the pure math view, complexity analysis is agnostic to this. Strictly speaking you'd have to define how your abstract machine works: O(n log n) is (again, strictly speaking) literally just a set of functions. In practice we usually hand-wave this away (not without problems: arithmetic taking time O(log n) and hash table lookups taking time O(1) are not consistent with each other!)
> 
> The unstated implication is that the theory tracks with real world behavior. This is more or less the case for simple problems: your O(n^2) algorithm won't scale, your database query without an index will take forever and so on, it's definitely a useful and high-signal way of thinking about computational problems.
> 
> Obviously modern hardware isn't much like a 70s machine and things like "all memory accesses are O(1)" are so wrong it's not even funny.
> 
> It's a pure thought experiment with no possible counterfactual, but I think if you tried to develop basic CS theory from a purely mathematical angle (e.g. consider a machine defined so and so with basic operations costing 1, let's run with this ball without caring much about the real world) you'd naturally end up with some (but not all) of the concepts we're used to. For example, arrays and buffers are very natural. We need more space than our basic unit of memory can accomodate, let's use several in a row. Pointers also follow very nicely, and with them structures like linked lists. Other stuff like B-trees and to some extent hash-tables and friends very much less so, they're definitely "imported" from real-world usage.

> 
> "Anthu" only responded with this after "feld" asked why the issue was closed by them, and only then the response you mentioned was written.
> 
> "Anthu" could have simply asked before closing the issue and the reporter would have been fine. Like, say "So, this issue meanwhile evolved into RFC compliance and got a bit off track in my opinion. Can you please open up a separate issue for this so we can get this fixed in a more focused manner? That would be very helpful for our workflow. If not, I would open up an issue and reference this one if that's okay with you."
> 
> My point is that feld felt a little ignored in their problem, and the support role could have handled it a little nicer. I get that maintainer time is limited, but I would probably recommend an issue template for these matters where there's checkboxes in them like "keep it short, keep it reproducible" and maybe a separate issue template and tag for RFC matters.
> 
> On the other hand, "feld"'s blog post reaction was also quite trigger happy and in part in bad faith. They could've communicated the same things in a "non rage mode" after things have calmed down a bit.

> This, I feel, clearly shows Feld's intentions - he wasn't interested in agetting it fixed, it was not a bug for him, but he was interested in spreading the word about it. i.e. To me, anyway, it  looks like Feld is more interested in writing outrage-bait than getting a working product.

**Parent comment**:
> I am sitting here in a 100+ year old stick frame house. The siding and shingles were replaced 10 years ago. There hasn't been any major structural work for at least 40 years.
> 
> What is your definition of "often"?

**This comment**:
> Most houses have asphalt shingles with an expected lifetime of ~15 years after which they start leaking and subject the house to the risk of mold. Contrast with ceramic tile shingles which easily last 75-100 years.
> 
> Of course you might say that durable materials exist in North America, but almost nobody chooses them. The likelihood of being able to move somewhere and be able to buy a modern durable house is ~0% in NA, and 30-90% in Europe depending on country and location. So you can do it in NA if you have enough money to rebuild a house. Good luck with that.

And yes with the tools we have you’re right, but I’m more lamenting the wonky, kind of archaic, unintegrated, only-semi-composable toolset that we have. No fundamental reason why you couldn’t deliver more structured UIs directly over SSH or a serial console, it’s just that in this timeline that didn’t happen yet (apart from X forwarding, which isn’t quite what I’m on about).

The answer is obviously yes, I don't really care whether you have a selective memory of that time.

**Parent comment**:
> It's interesting to me that whenever a new breakthrough in AI use comes up, there's always a flood of people who come in to handwave away why this isn't actually a win for LLMs. Like with the novel solutions GPT 5.2 has been able to find for erdos problems - many users here (even in this very thread!) think they know more about this than Fields medalist Terence Tao, who maintains this list showing that, yes, LLMs have driven these proofs: https://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems/wiki/AI-contri...

**This comment**:
> Because most times results like this are overstated (see the Cursor browser thing, "moltbook", etc.). There is clear market incentive to overhype things.
> 
> And in this case "derives a new result in theoretical physics" is again overstating things, it's closer to "simplify and propose a more general form for a previously worked out sequence of amplitudes" which sounds less magical, and closer to something like what Mathematica could do, or an LLM-enhanced symbolic OEIS. Obviously still powerful and useful, but less hype-y.

**This comment**:
> That paper from the 80s (which is cited in the new one) is about "MHV amplitudes" with two negative-helicity gluons, so "double-minus amplitudes". The main significance of this new paper is to point out that "single-minus amplitudes" which had previously been thought to vanish are actually nontrivial. Moreover, GPT-5.2 Pro computed a simple formula for the single-minus amplitudes that is the analogue of the Parke-Taylor formula for the double-minus "MHV" amplitudes.

**This comment**:
> Arguably it's precisely a paradigm shift. Continuing whatever worked until now is within the paradigm, our current theories and tools works, we find few problems that don't fit but that's fine the rest is still progress, we keep on hitting more problems or those few pesky unsolved problems actually appear to be important. We then go back to the theory and its foundations and finally challenge them. We break from the old paradigm and come up with new theories and tools because the first principles are now better understood and we iterate.

> So that's actually 2 different regimes on how to proceed. Both are useful but arguably breaking off of the current paradigm is much harder and thus rare.

**This comment**:
> I'm a big LLM sceptic but that's… moving the goalposts a little too far. How could an average Joe even understand the conjecture enough to write the initial prompt? Or do you mean that experts would give him the prompt to copy-paste, and hope that the proverbial monkey can come up with a Henry V? At the very least posit someone like a grad student in particle physics as the human user.

But my guess is it’s some combination of trying many different approaches in parallel (each in a fresh context), then picking the one that works, and splitting up the task into sequential steps, where the output of one step is condensed and is used as an input to the next step (with possibly human steering between steps)
