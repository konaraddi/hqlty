> Also, ‘years’ tend to be a lot more hours for kids, and each hour yields more learning due to neuroplasticity. I learned so much faster at 15 than I do at 35. I know more now, which often more than makes up for slower learning, but I can’t learn difficult novel subjects in depth as fast as I once did.

> I’m glad I learned OS in depth during high school via Gentoo linux. And engineering/physics/math in college. It’s very easy to assimilate any new knowledge which can be understood through those...

**This comment**:
> Can you really say that unless you switched fields multiple times? Of course you'll pick up on math and physics faster in high school than in college or postgrad, but that's because the problems get way, way harder as you progress. I've found that even in my late 30s I can still easily pick up new skills outside my field of expertise as long as I start with the basics that could also be picked up by a high-schooler. I started learning a new language last year and thanks to modern study apps, I actually find it easier today. Of course it will still take a long time to become an expert, but I'm not sure it would need more total hours than if I had started 20 years ago. It just gets more difficult to allocate the necessary hours for learning.

> The gambling analogy completely falls apart on inspection. Slot machines have variable reward schedules by design — every element is optimized to maximize time on device. Social media optimizes for engagement, and compulsive behavior is the predictable output. The optimization target produces the addiction.
> 
> What's Anthropic's optimization target??? Getting you the right answer as fast as possible! The variability in agent output is working against that goal, not serving it. If they could make it right 100% of the time, they would — and the "slot machine" nonsense disappears entirely. On capped plans, both you and Anthropic are incentivized to minimize interactions, not maximize them. That's the opposite of a casino. It's ... alignment (of a sort)
> 
> An unreliable tool that the manufacturer is actively trying to make more reliable is not a slot machine. It's a tool that isn't finished yet.
> 
> I've been building a space simulator for longer than some of the people diagnosing me have been programming. I built things obsessively before LLMs. I'll build things obsessively after.
> 
> The pathologizing of "person who likes making things chooses making things over Netflix" requires you to treat passive consumption as the healthy baseline, which is obviously a claim nobody in this conversation is bothering to defend.

> 
> This is a useful result, but it is important to note that this is not necessarily what people have in mind when they think of "LLMs generating skills." Having the LLM write down a skill representing the lessons from the struggle you just had to get something done is more typical (I hope) and quite different from what they're referring to.

**This comment**:
> I've made similar tessellations before, they can be curved. You can trivially make a pre-folded tessellation into a cylinder of arbitrary diameter; to curve it like a submarine, you'd just adjust the angle of the creases. Optimize the curve so the pressure is always perpendicular and there's no problem here.
> 
> The real issue here is that there's not much point in it, as the very thing that makes this useful (the ability to fold it up) would also make it collapse easily in a pressurized environment. You'd also have to deal with preventing leaks if you wanted air inside, likely by adding an outer hull, which would then defeat the purpose.

> Wow, that's a very torturous reading of a specific line in a standard. And it doesn't really matter what Yodaiken thinks this line means because standard is written by C implementers for (mostly) C implementers. So if C compile writers think this line means they can use UB for optimizing purposes, then that's what it means.

> Compiler writers are free to make whatever intentional choices they want and document them. UB is especially nasty compared to other kinds of bugs because implementors can't/refuse to commit to any specific behavior, not because they've chosen the wrong behaviors.

**This comment**:
> Do we know that? I've written "dead" code. It's point was to communicate structure or intent, but it was also still dead. This pattern, in one form or another, crops up a lot IME (in multiple languages, even, with varying abilities to optimize it):

> That `if` is "dead", in the sense that the condition is always false. But "dead" sometimes is just a proof — or if I'm not rigourous enough, an assumption — in my head. If the compiler can prove the same proof I have in my head, then the dead code is eliminated. If can't, well, presumably it is left in the binary, either to never be executed, or to be executed in the case that the proof in my head is wrong.

**This comment**:

> 
> My point is that it is easy to say "don't remove my code" while looking at a simple single-function example, but in actual compilation huge portions of a function are "dead" after inlining, constant propagation and other optimizations: not talking anything about C-specific UB or other shenanigans. You don't want to throw that out.

**This comment**:
> Some behaviors are left unspecified instead of undefined, which allows each implementation to choose whatever behavior is convenient, such as, as you put it, whatever the hardware does. IIRC this is the case in C for modulo with both negative operands.

> I would imagine that the standard writers choose one or the other depending on whether the behavior is useful for optimizations. There's also the matter that if a behavior is currently undefined, it's easy to later on make it unspecified or specified, while if a behavior is unspecified it's more difficult to make it undefined, because you don't know how much code is depending on that behavior.
