> > Is HIP a drop in replacement? No.
> 
> You don't understand what HIP is - HIP is AMD's runtime API. it resembles CUDA runtime APIs but it's not the same thing and it doesn't need to be - the hard part of porting CUDA isn't the runtime APIs. hipify is the thing that translates both runtime and kernels. Now is hipify a drop-in replacement? No of course but because the two vendors have different architectures. So it's absolutely laughable to imagine that some random could come anywhere near "drop-...

> This has always bugged me.  $7 million for a 30-second-long ad.  What do they get out of it?  Well, presumably, a change in peoples' concrete behaviors that is more than $7 million.  They expect that (otherwise they wouldn't buy the ad in the first place).
> 
> At the same time, we're told that all the sex and violence on TV doesn't matter, because it doesn't change peoples' behavior.
> 
> So, which is it?  Does what we watch on TV change our behavior, in concrete ways, or doesn't it?  I suspect that it does change our behavior, that the advertisers are right.  (They're betting a lot of money on their position; I'd expect them to have some basis for doing so before committing that kind of coin.)  But if so, then the rest of what we watch also changes our behavior.

> Personally I wouldn't mind paying for access but I doubt there is a critical mass of users that can be weaned off of free access. Competing with free networks is hard. Codeberg, as far as I can tell, basically has a donation model where you can volunteer to pay and be...

**This comment**:
> Maybe we need a display that just shows each user approximately what they cost.
> 
> Not a wikipedia banner. No guilt verbiage. No unrelatable total site/year numbers like "2.6M out of 5M goal" etc.
> 
> Just like some little bit of ui in a corner somewhere that passively just sits there and shows it's state like a red/yellow/green light or a battery meter or something. And what it shows is some at-a-glance representation of what you are costing the service, positive or negative.
> 
> If the org is open and low profit or even non profit, or even reasonable profit but organized as a co-op, this can be a totally honest number, which will probably be suprisingly small.
> 
> (and if any full-profit type services don't like having that kind of info made quite so public because it makes it hard to explain their own prices, well golly that sure sounds awful)
> 
> This will obviously have no effect on some people.
> 
> But I know that something like that will absolutely eat at some people until they decide they will feel better if they make that dot turn green.
> 
> And everyone else who just wants to take something for free and doesn't like being reminded of it, has no basis for complaining or claiming to be outraged at being nagged or browbeaten. It's a totally passive out of the way bit of display making no demands at all and not even hindering or speedbumping anything.
> 
> Even when you click on it for more info and the links to how to donate etc, the verbiage is careful not to make kids or drive-by laypeople or anyone else without real means feel bad or feel obligated. We don't need your soup money, don't sweat it.
> 
> Maybe even include some stories about how we all wound up in our high paying IT jobs because of the availability of stuff other people wrote and let us use for free when we were kids or former truck drivers etc, and so that's how you can understand and believe we really are ok with you now using this for free.
> 
> Can't possibly get any lighter touch than that.
> 
> And yet the fact that the little thing is just there all the time in view, that alone will make it like a voluntary itch that if you know you can afford it, you should make that light green. It's like a totally wholesome use of gamification psychology.
> 
> I guess it will also have to somehow show not just what  you cost yourself, but also what all the non-paying users are costing and what your fraction of that would be to cover those. At least some payers would need to pay significantly more than what they cost.
> 
> But I'd be real curious to see just how bad that skew is after a while if a lot of individuals do end up paying at least for themselves, where today most of them pay nothing.
> 
> That may make the need for whales much reduced and really no whales, just a bunch that only pay like twice what they cost. Or even less, a heavy user that costs more might be able to totally cover the entire cost of 10 other light users with only 10% more than their own cost. It could eventually smooth out to being no real burden at all even for the biggest payers.
> 
> That's getting to be a bit much info to display all in a single colored dot or something without text or some complicated graphic, but I think this much could be shown and still be simple and elegant. Even a simple dot can have several dimensions all at once. size, hue, saturation, brightness, let alone any more detail like an outline or more complex shape.
> 
> About the only thing I can see that is a bad thing is I bet this is a recipe for unfairly taxing women more than men. You just know that far more women will make that light green even if it's not easy, and far more men will happily let it ride forever even though they could afford it effortlessly, just to spend that $3 on a half of a coffee instead.

**Author**: homarp | **Depth**: 1 | **Signals**: 1 escalation keyword(s), 6 direct replies
**Link**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47049958

> I really liked this part:
> 
> In December 2024, during the frenzied adoption of LLM coding assistants, we became aware that such tools tended—unsurprisingly—to produce Go code in a style similar to the mass of Go code used during training, even when there were newer, better ways to express the same idea. Less obviously, the same tools often refused to use the newer ways even when directed to do so in general terms such as “always use the latest idioms of Go 1.25.” In some cases, even when explicitly told to use a feature, the model would deny that it existed. [...] To ensure that future models are trained on the latest idioms, we need to ensure that these idioms are reflected in the training data, which is to say the global corpus of open-source Go code.

**Parent comment**:
> Middling code should not exist.  Boilerplate code should not exist.  For some reason we're suddenly accepting code-gen as SOP instead of building a layer of abstraction on top of the too-onerous layer we're currently building at.  Prior generations of software development would see a too-onerous layer and build tools to abstract to a higher level, this generation seems stuck in an idea that we just need tooling to generate all that junk but can continue to work at this level.

**This comment**:
> But Go culture promulgates this practice of repeating boilerplate. In fact this is one of the biggest confusion points of new gophers. "I want to do a thing that seems common enough, what library are you all using to do X?". Everyone scoffs, pushes up their glasses and says, "well actually, you should just use the standard  library, it's always worked just fine for me". And the new gopher is confused because they really believe that reinventing the wheel is an acceptable practice. This is what leads to using LLMs to write all that code (admittedly, it's a fine use of an LLM).

I’ve been meaning to go through his old notebooks, as he took detailed notes on everything, to see if there is anything left from that era.

> Season 1 is Soul of a New Machine-ish, but about personal computing, not minicomputers, and is set in Texas.

> Season 2 is roughly about BBSs and Compuserve, and still in Texas.

> Season 3 is about the early commercial Internet, same characters, SFBA.
> 
> Season 4 is about the Yahoo era of the Internet and about venture capital, also SFBA.

> Seasons 3 and 4 did a really good job of capturing what it was like being in the industry and in SFBA in the mid/late 1990s, better than anything I've seen. I worked at McAfee (then NETA) at the time and the MCAF-ish stuff was uncanny; the last gasp of cubicle culture in the software product industry.
> 
> I liked the storytelling in it, but, like I said earlier, it's pretty Six Feet Under-ish, in that as it progresses it is less and less about the original concept of the show and more about the ...

**This comment**:
> Except that Mr Robot was always planned that way, you can go back and see references to what's revealed in the final episodes as early as the pilot. Things are revealed at the end of S1 that make you have to re-evaluate what you've seen so far. The same is probably even more true for S4.

> It's shocking how few people have seen this show, let along watched it. Part of that probably has to do with how inaccessible it is on streaming. It's only readily available on AMC+. And no one has AMC+.
> 
> This is one of those shows that would likely shoot to the top if Netflix got the rights to it and even did a mild push. It's genuinely peak prestige TV.

**This comment**:
> That is where I originally watched it.  It was on Netflix at one point.  And now, it is not.  Which is most of the problem with streaming service in general.

> Sonnet 4.6 feels like an evolution of whatever the previous models were doing. It is marginally better in the sense that it seemed to make fewer mistakes or with a lower level of severity, but ultimately it made all the usual mistakes (making things up, saying it'll quote a poem and then quoting another, getting time periods mixed up, etc).

> My initial experiments with coding leave the same feeling. It is better than previous similar models, but a long distance away from Opus 4.6. And I've really been spoiled by Opus.

The speed at which this stuff is improving is really remarkable; it feels like the breakneck pace of compute performance improvements of the 1990s.
