**Parent comment**:
> I don't know if I'm comfortable with any of this at all, but seems like having AI do "front line" judgments with a thinner appeals layer available powered by human judges would catch those edge cases pretty well.

**This comment**:
> To get to an appeal means you obviously already have a judgement against you - and as you can imagine in the cases like the one above that's enough to ruin your life completely and forever, even if you win on appeal.

> I feel like, today, most of the other LLM providers can do what "Apple Intelligence" promised - it'll link with my email/calendar/etc and it can find stuff I ask with a fuzzy search.
> 
> That said, I don't really use this functionality all that often, because it didn't really (effortlessly) solve a big need for me. Apple sitting out LLMs means they didn't build this competency along the way, even when the technology is now proven.

**This comment**:

> Contrast that with email, which is store-and-forward by design, and now you have to put in effort to ensure both the sending and receiving email providers delete the message in a timely manner.

**Parent comment**:
> Interesting. Won't stuff like entity extraction suffer? Especially in multilingual use cases. My worry is that a smaller model might not realize some text is actually a persons name because it is very unusual.

**This comment**:
> The model does not need to be that smart to understand that a name it does not know that starts with a capital letter is a the name of a place or a person. It does not need to be aware of whom this refers to, it just needs to transcribe it.
> 
> Also, there are generalist models that have enough of a grasp of a dozen or so languages that fit comfortably in 7B parameters. Like the older Mistral, which had the best multi-lingual support at the time, but newer models around that size are probably good candidates. I am not surprised that a multilingual specialised model can fit in 8B or so.

**Parent comment**:
> Concur. Zstandard is a good compressor, but it's not magical; comparing the compressed size of Zstd(A+B) to the common size of Zstd(A) + Zstd(B) is effectively just a complicated way of measuring how many words and phrases the two documents have in common. Which isn't entirely ineffective at judging whether they're about the same topic, but it's an unnecessarily complex and easily confused way of doing so.

Even when you stop typing to take a break for a moment, or after pushing code while you wait for the ci/cd pipeline, note down where you are and your last action or change.

> While this advice may work for some, I would like to point out that this person is making very popular art.  This type of art is most likely easier to sell than what most contemporary artists produce.

> Also, this remark is giving away a fairly limited view on art appreciation:
> 
> > While you can learn from failures, only sales strengthen the muscle because only they show that someone actually cares about what you are making
> 
> This is obviously not the case for art projects that target only a few people, or art practices that do not result in tangible objects.  (Although there are some exceptions, such as Marina Abramovich, but those are very limited.)
> 
> Great for them, but this is not about all art.  It just is impossible to live of most art forms.  This type of art fits well with our economy, and therefore makes a living.  That fit is more important than all the business advice put on top.
> 
> The article does point out exactly this problem, but glosses over the fact that most artists don't want to change to popular art.  Only a few can, and most don't want to.

> *  *Driving would actually be less efficient* — by the time you start the car, move it, and park, you’re already there.
> *  *Cold starts aren’t great for your engine* — very short drives don’t let the engine warm up properly.
> *  *It saves fuel and emissions*, even if it’s a tiny amount.
> *  You avoid the hassle of maneuvering such a short distance.
