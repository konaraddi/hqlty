**This comment**:
> I think that played a somewhat smaller role than Google seemingly gradually starting to take its position for granted and so everything became more focused on revenue generation and less focused on providing the highest quality experiences or results.
> 
> Beyond result quality it's absurd that it took LLMs to get meaningful natural language search. Google could have been working on that for many years, even if in a comparably simple manner, but seemingly never even bothered to try, even though that was always obviously going to be the next big step in search.

**Parent comment**:
> Let's be more precise: LLMs have to model the world from an intermediate tokenized representation of the text on the internet. Most of this text is natural language, but to allow for e.g. code and math, let's say "tokens" to keep it generic, even though in practice, tokens mostly tokenize natural language.

> They present a statistical model of an existing corpus of text.
> 
> If this existing corpus includes useful information it can regurgitate that.
> 
> It cannot, however, synthesize new facts by combining information from this corpus.
> 
> The strongest thing you could feasibly claim is that the corpus itself models the world, and that the LLM is a surrogate for that model. But this is not true either. The corpus of human produced text is messy, containing mistakes, contradictions, and propaganda; it has to be interpreted by someone with an actual world model (a human) in order for it to be applied to any scrnario; your typical corpus is also biased towards internet discussions, the english language, and western prejudices.

**This comment**:
> >This is a deranged and factually and tautologically (definitionally) false claim.
> 
> Strong words for a weak argument. LLMs are trained on data generated by physical processes (keystrokes, sensors, cameras), not telepathically extracted "mental models." The text itself is the artifact of reality and not just a description of someone's internal state. If a sensor records the temperature and writes it to a log, is the log a "model of a model"? No, it’s a data trace of a physical reality.
> 
> >All this removal and all these intermediate representational steps make LLMs a priori obviously even more distant from reality than humans.
> 
> You're conflating mediation with distance. A photograph is "mediated" but can capture details invisible to human perception. Your eye mediates photons through biochemical cascades-equally "removed" from raw reality. Proximity isn't measured by steps in a causal chain.
> 
> >The model humans use is embodied, not the textbook summaries - LLMs only see the diminished form
> 
> You need to stop thinking that a textbook is a "corruption" of some pristine embodied understanding. Most human physics knowledge also comes from text, equations, and symbolic manipulation - not direct embodied experience with quantum fields. A physicist's understanding of QED is symbolic, not embodied. You've never felt a quark.

> 
> Derive equations using valid mathematical reasoning
> 
> Make predictions that match experimental results
> 
> If they "only learn to write about physics," they shouldn't succeed at these tasks. The fact that they do suggests they've internalized the functional relationships, not just surface-level imitation.
> 
> >They can't run labs or interpret experiments like humans
> 
> Somewhat true. It's possible but they're not very good at it - but irrelevant to whether they learn physics models. A paralyzed theoretical physicist who's never run a lab still understands physics. The ability to physically manipulate equipment is orthogonal to understanding the mathematical structure of physical law. You're conflating "understanding physics" with "having a body that can do experimental physics" - those aren't the same thing.
> 
> >humans actually verify that the things they learn and say are correct and provide effects, and update models accordingly. They do this by trying behaviours consistent with the learned model, and seeing how reality (other people, the physical world) responds (in degree and kind). LLMs have no conception of correctness or truth (not in any of the loss functions), and are trained and then done.

LeCunn has been on that train for years so he's not an example of a change of heart. So far, nothing has actually come out of it. Even META isn't using V-JEPA to actually do anything, nevermind anyone else. Call me when these constructions actually best transformers.

**This comment**:
> > You, on the other hand, claim that there are infinite firsthand sensory experiences (maybe we can call them qualia?) that fall in between the cracks of language and are rarely communicated (though we use for that a wealth of metaphors and synesthesia) and can only be understood by those who have experienced them firsthand.
> 
> Well, not infinite, but, yes! I am indeed claiming much world models are patterns and associations between qualia, and that only some qualia are essentially representable as or look like linguistic tokens (specifically, the sounds of those tokens being pronounced, or their visual shapes if e.g. math symbols). E.g. I am claiming that the way one learns to e.g. cook, or "do theoretical math" may be more about forming associations between those non-linguistic qualia than, say, obviously, doing philosophy is.
> 
> > I'm not sure they constitute such a big part of our thought and communication
> 
> The communication part is mostly tautological again, but, yes, it remains very much an open question in cognitive science just how exactly thought works. A lot of mathematicians claim to lean heavily on visualization and/or tactile and kinaesthetic modeling for their intuitions (and most deep math is driven by intuition first), but also a lot of mathematicians can produce similar works and disagree about how they think about it intuitively. And we are seeing some progress from e.g. Aristotle using LEAN to generate math proofs in a strictly tokenized / symbolic way, but it remains to be seen if this will ever produce anything truly impressive to mathematicians. So it is really hard to know what actually matters for general human cognition.
> 
> I think introspection makes it clear there are a LOT of domains where it is obvious the core knowledge is not mostly linguistic. This is easiest to argue for embodied domains and skills (e.g. anything that requires direct physical interaction with the world), and it is areas like these (e.g. self-driving vehicle AI) where LLMs will be (most likely) least useful in isolation, IMO.

**Story**: Running Your Own As: BGP on FreeBSD with FRR, GRE Tunnels, and Policy Routing

**Parent comment**:
> > MSS clamping is non-negotiable with tunnels. Every layer of encapsulation eats into the MTU.
> 
> Can this tunnel be avoided somehow? If I have to choose between owning my prefix and having 1500 MTU, I'd probably take the latter: MTU issues are so annoying to deal with, and MSS-clamping doesn't solve all of them.

**This comment**:
> Kind of but not really.
> 
> The whole point of BGP is to influence your routing tables. This fundamentally makes very little sense to do when you have a bunch of routers whose routing policy you don't control between you and whoever you're speaking BGP to. eBGP is just TCP and supports knobs to run over multiple hops (so up to 255), but at that point you can't really do anything with the routing information you exchange because the moment you hand the traffic off, the other party can do with it how it pleases. Also, very few people have enough public IP addresses for this, and on the Internet you obviously can't route RFC1918 space. Therefore, you need tunnels, so that you can be one hop away even if the tunneled traffic is traversing the Internet, and so that you can reach peers that let you announce whatever IP space you want.
> 
> The other thing you can do, of course, is to just do the same thing internal to your lab. You can absolutely stand up multiple ASN at home. I'd even argue that if you really want to learn BGP, this is a great way to do it, especially if you use two different platforms (say, FRR on FreeBSD peering with a cheap Mikrotik running RouterOS). That way you learn the underlying protocol and not a specific implementation, which is something that is very hard to undo in junior network engineers that have only ever been exposed to one way of doing things.
> 
> That's different from some of the goals outlined in the article, but if your goal is to learn this stuff rather than have provider-independent IP space (which even for home labs isn't very valuable to most people), doing it all yourself works fine.

Abstraction is supposed to give you better high-level clarity at the expense of low-level detail. These $20,000 burning, Gas Town-style orchestration matrices do anything but simplify high level concerns. In fact, they seem committed building extremely complex, low-level harnesses of testing and validation and looping cycles around agents upon agents to avoid actually trying to deal with whatever specific problem they are trying to solve.

We end up with these Goodhart's Law solutions: they hit all of the required goals and declare victory, but completely fail in every reasonable metric that matters.

Though, I recall there's a PEG-based parser for C99/C11 floating around that was supposed to be compliant. But I'm having trouble finding a link, and maybe it was using something like LPeg, which has features beyond pure PEG that help ...

> 
> That's because SimCity is not a tool for preaching your personal opinions of what makes "more livable cities" to people who more often than not want to design semi-realistic, typical cities in an entertaining strategy game.
> 
> If you want to make your perfect city builder, go ahead, it's easier than ever now for somebody to create a game. Just don't expect everybody else to share your view of "aspirational", more so if you actively punish traditional city structures.

> Reading your comment, it sounds like you want a game that is realist...

**This comment**:
> That's not what I want at all. I want a more realistic sim that deals with issues such as sprawl, food deserts, transportation elasticity of demand, mental health issues (and their impact on crime and productivity), and a network-flow theoretical model of transportation and commuting contributes to all this. Building a bunch of sprawling suburbs that feed into a dense downtown core should make your citizens' commute times shoot way up and lead to misery.
> 
> A well-built large city isn't just going to be 100% biking and walking paths, it's going to have streetcars, light rail transit, subways, and buses as well as roads with cars. The difference is that people shouldn't be forced to commute across the entire city to get to work because you decided to cram all of the commercial zoning into one downtown core.

There are other more nuance (but studied) impacts, such as increased car accidents, mental impacts from increased isolation, etc. In America, there is even a correlation between how car-centric a community is and how often individuals are willing to seek out healthcare (even when accounting for access and affordability).

It establishes an exploitable path for supply-chain attacks: attacker "proves" themselves trustworthy on any project by behaving in an entirely helpful and innocuous manner, then leverages that to gain trust in target project (possibly through multiple intermediary projects).  If this sort of cross project trust ever becomes automated then any account that was ever trusted anywhere suddenly becomes an attractive target for account takeover attacks.
