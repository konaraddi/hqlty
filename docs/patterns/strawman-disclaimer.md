Distancing from a viewpoint while actively expressing it.

"I'm not one to subscribe to woke thinking, but [proceeds to describe actual social justice position]"

"I don't believe in conspiracy theories, but [shares conspiratorial reasoning]"

"I'm not a pessimist, but everything is getting worse."

"I'm not saying all corporations are evil, but [describes systemic corporate malfeasance]"

### Why It's Unproductive

Creates distance from a position while actively taking it, which makes the actual argument harder to engage with honestly. It's tempting because distancing from a label feels like claiming independence and nuance, but it signals wanting credit for thoughtfulness while avoiding vulnerability to criticism. Forces responders to address both the identity claim and the substance.

## The Better Move

"I think income inequality has gotten worse because [specific reasoning]."

"There are some concerning patterns in how this played out: [specific details]."

"This policy approach makes sense to me because [reasoning]."

"I disagree with [specific aspect] but think [your actual position] because [reasoning]."

### Why It's Better

Lets people respond to what's actually being argued. Makes the conversation about ideas rather than identity management, and earns nuance by demonstrating it.

## Example

**OP**: "We should have better protections for gig workers since they lack basic benefits."

**Antipattern reply**: "I'm not one to subscribe to the socialist thinking of Bernie Sanders, but we should have better protections for gig workers since they lack basic benefits."

**Better**: "I think we should have better protections for gig workers since they lack basic benefits. The current model shifts too much risk onto individuals."
