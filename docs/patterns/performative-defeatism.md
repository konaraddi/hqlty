Publicly declaring that outrage or concern will lead to no real action or change.

"We'll all upvote this today from the comforts of our couch then forget about it tomorrow. Nothing will change."

"Everyone will be mad for 24 hours and then move on like always."

"Cool, another thing for us to care about for a week before the next outrage cycle."

"People will share this, feel good about themselves, and do absolutely nothing."

### Why It's Unproductive

Announces futility before anyone has attempted action, making sincere engagement feel naive or pointless. It's appealing because cynicism reads as worldliness and preempting disappointment feels protective, but it discourages the very collective action being predicted to fail. Turns the conversation into performance criticism rather than problem-solving.

## The Better Move

"What can we actually do about this?"

"Has anyone tried organizing around this issue before? What worked?"

"This seems important. Where would donations or pressure actually help?"

"I'm genuinely asking: what would meaningful action look like here?"

### Why It's Better

Channels frustration toward possibility instead of resignation. Treats the conversation as a starting point rather than theater, creating space for people who do want to act.

## Example

**OP**: "Local company dumping waste into river faces no penalties after settlement."

**Antipattern reply**: "We'll all upvote this today from the comforts of our couch then forget about it tomorrow. Nothing will change."

**Better**: "This seems important. What can we actually do about this? Are there local environmental groups working on it?"
