title: Fallacy Labeling
---



Naming a logical fallacy instead of explaining what's actually wrong with the argument.

"That's a textbook straw man."

"Nice ad hominem."

"Slippery slope fallacy, next."

"Classic whataboutism."

### Why It's Unproductive

Sounds like rigorous thinking but skips the part that matters: explaining *why* the argument fails. Labeling a fallacy takes one second; engaging with the substance takes effort, and the label lets you skip that effort while still sounding like you won. Most of the time the label doesn't even apply cleanly, but it's hard to challenge without looking defensive.

## The Better Move

"I think that's a different issue from what I was arguing. Here's why..."

"I see the comparison, but I think the situations are different because..."

"That doesn't really address the point about X. Can we come back to that?"

"I don't think that follows, because..."

### Why It's Better

Points to the actual problem with the reasoning rather than just categorizing it. Keeps the conversation on substance instead of turning it into a logic exam.

## Example

**OP**: "Every time a major platform adds AI features, they also cut support staff. I think there's a connection."

**Antipattern reply**: "Correlation isn't causation. Classic logical fallacy."

**Better**: "Could be related, but companies cut support staff for lots of reasons, including cost pressure that has nothing to do with AI. Do you know if the timelines actually line up?"
