Taking a minor observation and forcing a connection to an unrelated broader claim or pet topic, hijacking the discussion.

- "And this is exactly why AI is taking over. Most people think they are more capable than they actually are."
- "This is why we need better CS education."
- "Perfect example of why regulation is needed."
- "Yet another reason the web is dying."

## Why It's Unproductive

Hijacks a specific discussion to promote a pre-existing thesis that isn't actually connected to the topic at hand. The logical leap sounds profound but is actually forced - one small observation doesn't validate a sweeping claim about industry trends or societal problems. Derails conversation from the specific issue to someone's hobby horse, preventing depth on the original topic.

## The Better Move

- "Yeah, it's surprising how often people miss important details in issue threads."
- "The issue body has good context. Worth reading the full thread."
- [Simply engage with the actual topic at hand]
- "This connects to a broader pattern I've noticed: [explain actual connection]."

### Why It's Better

Stays focused on the specific discussion. If there's a genuine connection to broader patterns, explain the logical link rather than just asserting it exists.

## Example

**OP**: "It's fascinating how few people read past the GitHub issue title before commenting."

**Antipattern reply**: "And this is exactly why coding with AI is not-so-slowly taking over. Most people think they are more capable than they actually are."

**Better**: "Yeah, the issue body has important details about the limitation. People miss a lot by just skimming titles."
