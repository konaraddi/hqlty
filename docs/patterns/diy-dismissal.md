title: DIY Dismissal

Telling someone to build it themselves instead of engaging with their critique or suggestion.

"If you don't like it, make your own."

"Sounds like a great project for you to start."

"PRs welcome."

"You're free to fork it."

### Why It's Unproductive

Sets an impossible bar for participation: you can only have opinions about things you're personally willing to build from scratch. It sounds empowering but works as a conversation-ender, reframing legitimate feedback as entitlement. By this logic, you can't discuss a film unless you're a director, or talk about city planning unless you're an engineer.

## The Better Move

"Interesting idea. What would that look like in practice?"

"I think there are trade-offs the current design handles well, like..."

"Fair point. I'd want to see how that works with the existing constraints."

"That's a real gap. I wonder if anyone's tried it."

### Why It's Better

Treats the suggestion as worth discussing on its merits. Engages with what was actually said rather than questioning whether the person has earned the right to say it.

## Example

**OP**: "I wish city-builder games explored alternatives to car-centric design."

**Antipattern reply**: "If you want your perfect city builder, go ahead and make one. It's easier than ever."

**Better**: "There are some interesting mods for that, but yeah, a game built around it from the start could be really compelling."
