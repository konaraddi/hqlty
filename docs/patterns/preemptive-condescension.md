title: Preemptive Condescension
sidebar_position: 112
---



Prefacing corrections or facts with phrases that frame the other person as naive or about to be humbled.

"You will be disappointed to know that..."

"I hate to break it to you, but..."

"Surely you realize that..."

"I'm afraid you're going to find out that..."

### Why It's Unproductive

Frames correction as humiliation and makes the other person defensive before they've even heard the substance. It's tempting because it feels like demonstrating superior knowledge, but it prioritizes ego protection over information exchange. Even accurate facts get resisted when delivered with built-in condescension.

## The Better Move

"Worth noting that..."

"One thing to consider: ..."

"From what I've seen, ..."

"Actually, the data shows..."

### Why It's Better

Gets to the substance without the performance. Lets the information stand on its own merit, making it easier for someone to update their view without feeling humiliated.

## Example

**OP**: "I think the policy will reduce costs significantly."

**Antipattern reply**: "You will be disappointed to know that similar policies in other states increased costs by 15%."

**Better**: "Worth noting that similar policies in other states increased costs by 15%. What makes this version different?"
