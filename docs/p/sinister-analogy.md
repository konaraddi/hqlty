Responding to a neutral point by invoking an extreme negative historical parallel, letting the dark association do the arguing.

"And Stalin had Lysenko."

"That's exactly what they said about Theranos."

"You know who else thought centralized planning was efficient?"

"Sounds a lot like what Enron promised."

### Why It's Unproductive

Sounds historically informed but substitutes association for argument. Drawing a line from "Einstein had collaborators" to "Stalin had Lysenko" isn't a rebuttal; it's guilt by the thinnest possible connection. It forces the other person to defend against an extreme comparison they never invited, and any attempt to push back ("this isn't like Stalin") sounds like minimizing the historical atrocity. The dark reference does the heavy lifting so the person making it never has to explain the actual connection.

## The Better Move

"I see the parallel you're drawing, but I think the key difference is..."

"Collaboration can go wrong, sure. What specifically concerns you here?"

"There are real risks with this approach. The one I'd focus on is..."

"That comparison is a stretch. The actual concern I'd raise is..."

### Why It's Better

Raises specific concerns rather than letting a loaded reference do the work. If there's a genuine lesson from history, it's worth spelling out instead of just dropping a name.

## Example

**OP**: "Humans have always worked with tools and assistants. Even Einstein relied heavily on collaborators."

**Antipattern reply**: "And Stalin had Lysenko."

**Better**: "True, but the dynamic changes when the 'assistant' is opaque and controlled by a single company. The collaboration analogy has limits."
