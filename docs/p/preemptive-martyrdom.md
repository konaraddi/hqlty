Predicting negative reactions to preemptively claim victim status or appear brave.

"This will probably get downvoted, but..."

"I know I'll be attacked for this..."

"Unpopular opinion, but..."

"Go ahead and hate me, but..."

### Why It's Unproductive

Frames the conversation as hostile before it begins and positions the speaker as a brave truth-teller facing persecution. It's tempting because it feels like showing courage, but it manipulates the audience by suggesting disagreement equals unfairness. Turns what could be substantive debate into a referendum on the speaker's treatment.

## The Better Move

"I think..."

"My take is..."

"From what I've seen..."

"Here's a different perspective..."

### Why It's Better

Lets the idea stand on its own merits without framing disagreement as persecution. Invites genuine discussion rather than forcing readers to prove they're fair-minded.

## Example

**OP**: "Should we add more bike lanes downtown?"

**Antipattern reply**: "This will probably get downvoted, but I think bike lanes actually make traffic worse."

**Better**: "I think bike lanes can sometimes worsen traffic flow. Has anyone looked at the data from similar cities?"
