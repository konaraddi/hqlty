Focusing on a minor technicality or semantic detail to avoid engaging with the actual substance of an argument.

- "Who are these 'creators'? Can you point to them? Is there a legal entity?"
- "That's not technically a compiler, it's a transpiler."
- "You said 'current' but he died in 2013."
- "Actually, it's GNU/Linux."

## Why It's Unproductive

Derails conversation from the substantive point to an irrelevant precision issue. While the technical correction might be valid, leading with it (and making it the entire response) signals that precision matters more than understanding the actual argument. People often do this when they feel defensive about the main point but can find a technicality to be "right" about.

## The Better Move

- "Different desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, etc.) have different development teams. Which one gave you trouble?"
- "Fair point about the tools, though I'd note it's technically a transpiler. Does that change your argument?"
- "Banks is great. Are there contemporary authors in that same tier?"
- "The Linux kernel vs. full distribution distinction matters in some contexts. What's your concern about the desktop environment?"

### Why It's Better

Either addresses the actual substance first and mentions the technicality separately, or explains why the technical detail actually matters to the discussion. Shows you understood the point even if the wording was imprecise.

## Example

**OP**: "The Linux desktop creators should fix these bugs before expecting people to switch."

**Antipattern reply**: "Who are these 'creators'? Can you point to them? Is there a legal entity?"

**Better**: "Fair criticism. Different desktop environments have different teams (GNOME, KDE, etc.). Which one blocked you?"
