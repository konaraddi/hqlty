A reference for online discourse antipatterns, the subtle conversation moves that derail productive discussion.

## What This Is

A collection of common patterns that sound reasonable but damage dialogue. Each pattern includes examples, why it backfires, and better alternatives.

## Patterns

See the [patterns](patterns/) directory for all documented antipatterns.

## How to Link to Patterns

When you see an antipattern in a discussion, linking to a pattern page can help get the conversation back on track. Here's how to do it constructively:

### Good Linking

The goal is to improve the conversation, not to win or shame someone. Good links:

- **Acknowledge shared goals**: "I think we both want to understand this better. This pattern might be getting in the way: [link]"
- **Include yourself**: "I catch myself doing this too. Might be helpful: [link]"
- **Focus on the pattern, not the person**: "This feels like [pattern]. Maybe we can reframe?"
- **Stay collaborative**: "I wonder if we're falling into [pattern] here. What do you think?"

**Examples:**

> "I think we're both trying to get at the truth here. This might be an example of [hindsight dismissal](patterns/hindsight-dismissal.md). What aspects of the research surprised you?"

> "I've done this before too, but 'you will be disappointed to know' comes across as [preemptive condescension](patterns/preemptive-condescension.md). What's the actual concern?"

### Links to Avoid

Don't use pattern links as weapons. Avoid:

- **Gotcha linking**: "Ha! You're doing [pattern]!"
- **Dismissive linking**: "This is just [pattern]. Next."
- **Condescending linking**: "You clearly don't understand that this is [pattern]."
- **Piling on**: Linking to multiple patterns at once to overwhelm

**Why This Matters:**

Someone who gets linked here might be feeling defensive or called out. The way you link sets the tone for whether they'll be open to adjusting or dig in further. Be the discourse you want to see.
