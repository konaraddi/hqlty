## The Pattern

Nitpicking word choice or definitions to avoid engaging with the main argument.

"Well, technically that's not X, it's Y."

"You used the wrong term. It's actually called..."

"Define 'common' / 'often' / 'many'."

"That's not what [word] means."

### Why It's Unproductive

Sounds like seeking precision but derails into dictionary debates instead of addressing substance. It's tempting because correcting terminology feels like demonstrating expertise, but it substitutes semantic quibbling for engaging with the actual point. Even if the correction is valid, leading with it signals more interest in being right about words than understanding the argument.

## The Better Move

"I think you mean [term], but I understand your point. What about [substantive response]?"

"Minor note: the technical term is [X]. On the main point, I think..."

"If I'm understanding correctly, you're saying [restate in own words]. Is that right?"

"The terminology aside, the core question seems to be..."

### Why It's Better

Acknowledges imprecision without making it the focus. Shows that understanding the substance matters more than scoring points on word choice, and keeps the conversation moving forward.

## Example in Context

**Original**: "The company's monopolistic practices are harming consumers."

**Antipattern**: "They're not a monopoly. Technically, they only have 65% market share. A monopoly is 100%."

**Better**: "They don't meet the strict legal definition of monopoly, but I agree that market concentration at that level raises concerns. What remedies do you think would help?"
